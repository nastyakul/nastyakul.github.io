I'm also an expat and always on the look-out for like-minded people. That's actually one of the reasons for creating the website!

### 📍curious about DS applications in sustainability

I gave a couple of talks on data science in energy (see slides in 🇷🇺 [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jlVBsspsxgcqi3wwRTbtgHURBg7FLHuXOfv5dxxZnDE/edit?usp=sharing)) and always up for telling and learning more.

### 📍starting a career in climate tech

Over the course of my career, I reviewed dozens of CVs and even started a peer-review challenge in my network. Currently, I feel most excited about helping others to navigate careers with purpose landscape in Europe and beyond.
