# 👩🏼‍💻 About me
------

I'm an Amsterdam-based Data Science generalist with 3+ years of experience, most of them -- with energy data. I can build (mostly) regression models, wrap them in APIs and keep an eye on them with dashboards and alerting systems in production. Oh, and people say they like how I host Agile retrospectives! More on that in [my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePS3ycRbchfW6ap9Cz7s0W_FWXrg74w9/view?usp=sharing).

I'm also an expat and always on the look-out for like-minded people. That's actually one of the reasons for creating the website!

### 📍 curious about DS applications in sustainability

I gave a couple of talks on data science in energy (see slides in RU [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jlVBsspsxgcqi3wwRTbtgHURBg7FLHuXOfv5dxxZnDE/edit?usp=sharing)) and always up for telling and learning more.



### 📍 starting a career in climate tech

Over the course of my career, I reviewed dozens of CVs and even started a peer-review challenge in my network. Currently, I feel most excited about helping others to navigate careers with purpose landscape in Europe and beyond.



### 📍 a start-up founder without a background in data science

For a startup participating in [Startupbootcamp](https://www.startupbootcamp.org/) Sustainability accelerator I provided a consultation on analytics & data science tooling (commercial and open-source), proof of concept and advised on first hires.
